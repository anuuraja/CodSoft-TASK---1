        Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle's 
        historic Pike place Market.It was here Starbucks opened its first
        store,offering fresh-roasted coffee beans,tea and spices from around
        the world for our customers to take home.Our name was inspired by the 
        classic tale,"Mock-Dick",evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffeetraders.
        Ten years later,a young New yorker named Howard schultz would walk through these doors
        and become captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first step.After joining the company
        in 1982,a diffrent cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery.It was on a trip
        to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy's coffeehouses,and he returned to Seattle
        inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks.By 1987,We
        swapped our brown asprons for green ones and embarked on our next chapter as as Coffeehouse.
        Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver,Canada and then on to California,
        Washington,D.C and New York.By 1996,we would cross the pacific to open our fisrt store 
        in Japan,followed by Europe in 1998 and china in 1999.Over the next two decades,we would 
        grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a part of the fabric of tens
         of thousands of neighbourhoods all around the world.In everything we do,we are always dedicated
         to our Mission.With every cup,with every conversation,with every community-we nurture the limitless
         possibilities of human connection.
